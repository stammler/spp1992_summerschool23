# Dust Evolution Workshop
## SPP 1992 Summer School 2023

This repository contains material used for the Dust Evolution Workshop during the [SPP 1992 Summer School 2023](https://www-astro.physik.tu-berlin.de/exoplanet-diversity/spp-1992-summer-school-2023/).

The workshop focuses mainly on the usage of the dust evolution code [DustPy](https://stammler.github.io/dustpy/), as well as its extension library [DustPyLib](https://dustpylib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Participants are asked to follow the installation instructions in advance of the workshop and make sure that the example setups execute without problems. In case of problems or questions please write to [stammler@usm.lmu.de](mailto:stammler@usm.lmu.de).

### Installation
