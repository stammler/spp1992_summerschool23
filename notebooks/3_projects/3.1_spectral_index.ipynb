This can be achieved for example by having several transitions in the fragmentation velocity as in the [\"Ice Lines\" example](https://stammler.github.io/dustpy/example_ice_lines.html) in the DustPy documentation. You can either let the simulation run until the dust distribution has reached their limits or manually set the distributions as shown in the tutorial.\n",

Can you confirm that optically thick regions tend have a spectral index of $2$? Can you see a difference in the spectral index in the different fragmentation velocity regions of the disk? Can you distinguish a fragmentation-limited size distribution from a drift-limited size distribution?"
